          <h2 class='experience-header'>Bio</h2>
          <p>In Feb 2022 I have left the BA role behind and focused on Software Development only.</p>
          <p>I joined Flobotics as
            a Robotic Process Automation Developer, and got both UiARD (UiPath Certified Advanced RPA Developer) and
            Robocorp's level III certificate in the same year.</p>
          <p>I work with both UiPath and Robot Framework technologies, they
            are both great but if you'd ask me - I'd prefer working with Python. üêç </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-chunk">
          <h2 class='experience-header'>About Me</h2>
          <p>I believe that software development is not really about coding but about communication between people. That
            understanding what exactly we require from each other and communicating it is the most important part of the
            process. I'm an open-minded, easy-going guy, and I do listen to and respect my clients. I believe that
            mutual trust is the driving force behind successful deliveries.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When it comes to coding, I believe in perfection through iteration. Once we know what part brings the most
            value, we can build the project step-by-step, gathering the feedback along the way, eating that elephant one
            bite at a time. üêò</p>
          <br>
          <p>And what motivates me and drives me forward? Throughout my early career, I was struggling a lot with
            repetitive tasks. I know how effective they are in murdering creativity and motivation. In RPA, each
            delivered project makes somebody's work easier, and that smile and gratitude are the greatest rewards the
            developer can get.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bio-chunk">
          <h2 class='experience-header'>Culture</h2>
          <p>I prefer working in small agile structures, learning from each other, pair programming and regular code
            reviews is a great asset for me.
            I also like working on my own directly with the client, taking ownership of the project brings me a lot of
            self-satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>Working from home is also important to me, I like to socialize in the office every once in a while, but my
            home
            laboratory is where I focus best.</p>

            <h3>RPA Developer at Flobotics</h3>
            <p>In Flobotics, I'm delivering projects mainly in UiPath, Robocorp, and Python over Robot Framework. I
              worked for a US-based financial company, automating day-to-day tasks for the finance and IT departments, a
              travel agency, and happily automating internal tasks for marketing departament.</p>

            <h4>Contract for Polish Air Navigation Services Agency</h4>
            <p class='info-exp-text'>As a member of a small, highly specialized team outsourced to PANSA, I was
              responsible for the technical side of the project - collecting and managing data from all available
              sources, parsing, rapid database development, and quick, ad-hoc analysis. I was also supporting the
              financial team in IT solutions, maintaining and expanding existing tools.</p>

            <h3>JUNIOR BUSINESS ANALYST at Carlson Wagonlit Travel</h3>
            <p class='info-exp-text'>Working in the Global FP&A team brought my skills to another level since reporting,
              report development, and automating tasks with VBA became my daily routine. I've added relational
              databases, SQL, and data processing to my stack, learned Python fundamentals on my own, together with data
              science tools like Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter Notebook.</p>

            <h3>SCHEDULER / CLIENT ADMINISTRATOR FOR LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS at Bureau Veritas HUB Poland</h3>
            <p class='info-exp-text'>While my main tasks were to schedule and organize audits for one of the strategic
              clients, I also developed a planning tool in MS Excel to speed up the process and created an automated
              reporting mechanism with VBA, which saved around 4h of manual work per week. Even though scheduling was
              not IT-related, I've learned all about key-customer service, communication, delivering on time, and
              relationship management which I believe is crucial in software development.</p>
