          <h2 class='experience-header'>Bio</h2>
          <p>I worked as a business analyst with a strong technical foundation, specializing in data analysis,
            databases, reporting, and automation. Additionally, I undertook roles as a BA consultant for the Polish Air
            Navigation Services Agency.</p>
          <p>In 2022, I fully switched my focus to coding and embarked on my RPA journey as an RPA Developer / RPA
            Consultant. Working across various industries, including healthcare and finance, I
            automated daily tasks for clients and maintained the existing robotic workforce.</p>
          <p>I also had the opportunity to participate in a project as a BA, where I gathered requirements and
            translated business needs into technical language.</p>

          <div class="bio-chunk">
            <h2 class='experience-header'>About Me</h2>
            <p><b>Hobbies:</b> My passion for music has led me to perform in Rock 'n Roll bands for years, back in the
              days :)
              I still develop this hobby by collecting vinyl records. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Biggest archievement:</b> doing what I love for a living. But also, leasing the development of a
              Python based automation
              that evolved into a main outreach marketing tool for my company.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Values:</b> I believe in ownership and independence, taking responsibilities for the work done, trust,
              honesty and partnership instead of hierarchy and control.
              I prefer working in small agile structures, or working on my own directly with the client. </p>
            <p>Taking ownership of the project brings me a lot of self-satisfaction. Working remotely is important to
              me, I love to socialize in the office every once in a while, but my home laboratory is where I focus best.

              not IT-related, I've learned all about key-customer service, communication, delivering on time, and
              relationship management which I believe is crucial in software development.</p>
